## Description

I was motivated to create this project because I wanted to practice deploying on Heroku and create an installation that can run on a web browser. JATE is a Progressive Web Application that allows a user to enter and edit text which will be stored locally as an indexed database and can be accessed offline. The application can also be installed and run natively outside the browser.

## Installation

To install the application locally, click "install" from the website and follow the prompt(s).

## Usage

Type and edit text in the given numbered lines within the application. To trigger a store to the local database, click outside of the browser/application to remove focus from it. All changes store to localstorage as well. The application can continue to be used offline with data still being stored.
